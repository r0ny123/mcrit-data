.github/workflows/windows-reference-data.yml builds the families that need
MSVC - VX-API, BlackBone, SysWhispers - on a windows-2022 runner and uploads
the results with actions/upload-artifact instead of committing them, so that a
maintainer reviews them before they enter the corpus. Nothing carried out the
other half of that: the five MSVC artefacts in data/ were downloaded and
placed by hand, and a planned wave of MSVC builds across ~30 library families
would mean a manual download, unpack and merge per family. This is that half.

What makes it more than "unzip into data/":

* Each job uploads only the architecture it built. The checkout it builds from
  already holds the committed artefacts of the *other* architecture, so the
  workflow's "Scope the artefacts to what this job produced" step prunes the
  tree to the slugs that run actually produced, and - because provenance.json
  is per-family rather than per-architecture - writes a provenance.<arch>.json
  beside it and uploads that instead. Unpacking both artifacts naively let
  whichever landed last overwrite the other architecture's records; for
  SysWhispers, whose x86 leg builds nothing, the x86 copy is an empty object
  and would have reverted the x64 leg outright. Records are merged here, per
  family, across architectures and with what is already committed.

* upload-artifact strips the longest common directory prefix of the files it
  matches. With all three families present that prefix is "data", so the zip
  is rooted at <Family>/..., not data/<Family>/...; build a single family and
  the prefix becomes data/<Family> and the zip is rooted at <arch>/...  The
  tree is therefore located from the provenance records - which carry the full
  repository-relative path of every file - rather than from the zip's shape.

* Nothing committed is destroyed by a failure. Every artefact is verified
  before anything is written, and the writes go through corpus.package, whose
  commit_artifacts stages both files beside their targets and moves them into
  place with os.replace. This repository has already lost an archive to an
  interrupted in-place write; the same discipline applies here.

Verification, per artefact, before a byte of data/ is touched:

* the downloaded zip matches the sha256 GitHub records for the artifact;
* the tree is exactly data/<Family>/<arch>/{smda,mcrit}/<slug>.{7z,mcrit},
  with <arch> and <Family> agreeing with the record's own fields;
* the .7z and the .mcrit are both present - a lone one of either is refused,
  and so is a file no provenance record accounts for;
* the .7z holds exactly one <slug>.smda and nothing else;
* the sha256 recorded in provenance is the digest of the analysed binary, so
  it cannot be recomputed from the artefact - what is checked instead is that
  the record, the SMDA report inside the .7z and the sample entry inside the
  .mcrit all name the same digest, which is what a mixed-up or truncated
  upload breaks;
* num_functions in the record equals the report's statistics and the export's,
  and family, version and component agree across all three;
* the export carries the corpus minhash and shingler config hashes, since one
  that disagrees would import into MCRIT and then match nothing;
* neither file is over the GitHub blob limit.

Exits non-zero if any artefact failed verification or could not be committed.
