"""Identify compiler runtime glue so it is not attributed to a library family.

Every MinGW-linked DLL or EXE carries startup, unwind-registration and CRT
import glue that belongs to the compiler runtime, not to the project being
built. The MinGW runtime already has its own coverage in this repository
(data/MinGW), so leaving those functions labelled with a library's family name
would both duplicate existing reference data and mis-attribute it - the kind of
mistake commit 0108024 ("fixed two family mismappings") had to correct by hand.

Rather than hardcoding a symbol list that would rot with the next GCC, the
baseline is measured: an empty translation unit is linked with the same
toolchain, and the functions SMDA recovers from it define the glue set. A
function in a real build counts as glue only when both its symbol name and its
PicHash match the baseline, so a project that ships its own ``strlen`` keeps it.

The MSVC side is the same idea with three more things to measure, because
Microsoft's runtime is larger than GCC's in ways that matter here. ATL and
the MSVC STL have no GCC counterpart and are instantiated per type, so a
probe covers exactly the instantiations it names. And MSVC ships its C
runtime twice: ``/MT`` links it statically while ``/MD`` leaves it in
ucrtbase.dll and vcruntime140.dll behind a one-instruction import thunk, and
the two flavours are not the same bytes even for the startup and /GS code
that is statically linked either way. Both MSVC recipes in this repository
build ``/MD``, so the probes are built both ways and unioned.

What each MSVC probe is for was read off the committed reports rather than
guessed; the comment above each one says which measurement it answers.

The Linux side is by far the smallest of the three, and measurably so: 28
symbols on x64 and 37 on x86, against 2893 for MinGW x64. A ``-shared`` ELF
object links glibc, libstdc++ and libm dynamically, so none of their bodies
are in the image at all - every call to them is a ``.plt`` stub, which
carries no symbol and is not what this filter is for. What is left is of two
kinds, and the measured split is the argument for building ``.so`` artefacts
on this side rather than static executables:

* The objects ld links in regardless, 7 of them on x64 and 18 on x86:
  crti/crtn's _init and _fini, Scrt1.o's _start, crtbeginS's
  register_tm_clones, deregister_tm_clones, __do_global_dtors_aux and
  frame_dummy, and on x86 __stack_chk_fail_local, the four
  __x86.get_pc_thunk.* PIC helpers, and libgcc.a's 64-bit division set -
  __divdi3, __moddi3, __divmoddi4, __udivdi3, __umoddi3, __udivmoddi4. That
  last one is why the division block from _PROBE_DLL is carried over into
  _PROBE_LINUX_C: libgcc is the one static archive still in play here, and
  those six were found leaking across four families on the Windows side.
* libstdc++ templates the headers instantiate into whatever uses them, 21 on
  x64 and 19 on x86. Those are in the image because they are compiled from
  the probe's own translation unit, exactly as they are on the MinGW side.

Nothing of glibc itself is in either list, which answers the question a
glibc probe set would have been for: there is no glibc body in a dynamically
linked .so to measure or to remove.

# MinGW only, and the character-at-a-time half of stdio that _PROBE_DLL never
# touches. That probe formats, seeks and reads blocks; it never calls printf,
# puts, fgetc, fputc, feof, rewind or atoi, so none of those were in the
# baseline and all of them were being filed under whichever family linked
# them. It is measurable in the committed data: q3vm's MinGW x64 report is 20
# functions of which printf, puts and rewind are msvcrt import thunks wearing
# the q3vm family name, and 4g3nt47/Obfuscator - seven functions of its own -
# came out at 28 on x64 with feof, fgetc, printf twice, rewind and atoi among
# them.
#
# Two things about the printf family in particular, both measured rather than
# assumed, because they are what an obvious version of this probe gets wrong:
#
#   * The format has to be one the optimiser cannot see. mingw-w64's stdio.h
#     defines printf as a static inline wrapper around __mingw_vfprintf, and
#     given a literal format GCC clones it as printf.constprop.0 - so the
#     name the artefacts carry, plain "printf", is never in the probe image
#     at all. The first draft of this probe did exactly that and removed
#     nothing. Reading the format out of a volatile pointer defeats the clone
#     and is the same trick the math block above uses against builtins.
#   * The wrapper is compiled from the probe's own translation unit, so its
#     body is whatever the optimiser makes of it, and the PicHash follows:
#     on x64 the same wrapper is 25 instructions at -O0, 19 at -O1, 19 with a
#     different hash at -O2 and 18 at -Os, four distinct PicHashes for one
#     name. probe_command builds at -O2, which matches every recipe here
#     except Obfuscator's -O0, so this source is registered a second time at
#     -O0 below. That second registration is narrow and was measured: it adds
#     a second PicHash for exactly the mingw-w64 header wrappers - printf,
#     fprintf, sprintf, snprintf, vprintf, vfprintf, vsprintf, vsnprintf,
#     fscanf, strtof - and for nothing else, because everything else in the
#     image comes out of the prebuilt CRT archives rather than out of this
#     translation unit.
#
# One source rather than lines added to _PROBE_DLL, on the standing rule in

# MSVC only, and the second round of STL probes. Everything below answers a
# measurement of what the *first* round left behind, so it is worth recording
# what that measurement said, because it is not what it looked like.
#
# Reading the committed exports back (scripts/corpus/baseline.py cannot do
# this itself - it was done by decompressing function_entries out of the four
# .mcrit files) and splitting the surviving runtime functions by whether the
# instantiating type is the project's own:
#
#     BlackBone x64   1677 functions   274 runtime   124 over standard types
#     BlackBone x86   1875 functions   254 runtime   125 over standard types
#     VX-API    x64    699 functions    17 runtime    17 over standard types
#     VX-API    x86    686 functions    20 runtime    20 over standard types
#
# The 124 and 125 are the reachable part. The surprise is in how they missed:
# of BlackBone x64's 124, exactly *three* carry a name that also appears in
# that artefact's removed_runtime_functions list. The other 121 have names
# the round-one probe never produced at all - not names it produced with a
# different body.
#
# The reason is that MSVC instantiates a member template on its argument
# category and width, not just on the container type. The round-one probe has
# std::unordered_map<std::wstring, unsigned int> and so does BlackBone, but
# the probe writes `byName.emplace(wstring, 2u)` and BlackBone writes the
# equivalent of `byName.emplace(wstring, someUnsignedLong)`, which is
# `emplace<wstring, unsigned long &>` - a different function with a different
# name, and name is half of what is_glue matches on. The same split explains
# vector (`push_back(x)` is `_Emplace_one_at_back<T &>`, `push_back(x + 1)`
# is `_Emplace_one_at_back<T>`), map (`emplace(a, b)` on lvalues versus
# prvalues) and unordered_map's operator[] (`_Try_emplace<K const &>` versus
# `_Try_emplace<K>`).
#
# Two smaller causes were measured alongside it and are fixed here too:
#
#   * The round-one hash probe assigned the *same* key in each iteration of
#     its loop - `byName[std::wstring(name)] = index` - so those maps never
#     held more than one element and _Forced_rehash, _Hash_vec::_Assign_grow
#     and the _List_node helpers they call were never instantiated at all.
#     Every loop below builds distinct keys and inserts enough of them to
#     force several rehashes.
#
#   * The mapped type of BlackBone's forwarder map is `unsigned __int64` on
#     x64 and `unsigned int` on x86; it is std::size_t on each. The round-one
#     probe spelled it `unsigned long long`, which is the x64 instantiation
#     on both architectures, so the x86 one was never in the baseline. Same
#     for its ptr_t-keyed unordered_map.
#
# Split four ways for the usual reason: a probe that will not build is not
# fatal, but it silently shrinks the baseline, so one bad line should cost
# one container family rather than all of them.

# `<lambda_HEX>` appearing in nlohmann_json, protobuf, re2 and abseil - which
# share no code - means a lambda out of a header all four include. Reading
# the committed reports back identifies it exactly, because the function that
# takes the lambda carries it in its own name:
#
#     std::basic_string<char,...>::_Reallocate_grow_by<
#         <lambda_65e615be2a453ca0576c979606f46740>,char const *,unsigned __int64>
#
# The types after the lambda are the arguments the member forwards, so each
# one names a std::string member exactly:
#
#     <char>                              push_back(char)
#     <char const *,size_t>               append(const char *, size_t)
#     <size_t,char>                       append(size_t, char) / resize

#     <size_t,size_t,char const *,size_t> replace(off, count, ptr, count)
#
# and the bodies agree: the replace lambda is three memcpy calls (prefix,
# replacement, tail), the push_back one is a memcpy followed by storing one
# character and a NUL.
#
# Three of these are already in the baseline - the provenance of all four
# families shows the append, resize and insert(off,count,char) lambdas being
# removed - and they come from _PROBE_STL_SEQ's probe_stl_string, which calls
# append, resize and insert(begin(), ch) once each. So the mechanism works:
# a probe that calls the member emits the lambda, name and body both.
#
# replace and insert(off, ptr, count) are simply not called anywhere in this
# file, which accounts for the two residual replace lambdas outright.
#
# push_back is the one this cannot explain. _PROBE_STL_GROW does call
# std::string::push_back, in a loop, and that probe demonstrably builds - its
# unique_ptr<_IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY,void (__cdecl*)(void *)> destructor is
# in BlackBone x64's removed list and exists nowhere else here - yet no
# push_back lambda is in the glue set on either architecture. Nothing in the
# committed data says why. This is therefore a second attempt rather than a
# change to a probe that works: a small translation unit whose only subject
# is <xstring> growth, calling push_back from three separate exported
# functions so the compiler has no single obvious place to put the body.
# That is the same reasoning _PROBE_ATL_MODULES and _PROBE_ATL_THROW are
# written on.

# Every offset is 0 so no call can be out of range: replace and insert throw

# a variable amount. They are the exact MSVC analogue of libgcc's
# __udivmoddi4, which round one of the MinGW work caught. On x64 every one of
# these is an instruction, so this unit compiles there and measures nothing.
#
# Which of them the probes already reach was measured from the committed
# provenance rather than guessed. _PROBE_DLL's 64-bit division block is
# compiled by cl as probe_md.c, and its removed_runtime_functions show that
# it already contributes _alldiv, _aulldiv, _allrem, _aullrem, _aulldvrm,
# _allmul, _allshl and _aullshr. The one missing member of that family is
# _allshr - the arithmetic right shift, which needs a *signed* 64-bit value
# and a variable count - and it is sitting in 7-Zip, LuaJIT and sqlite3.
#
# The conversion helpers need more care, because there are two sets of them
# and the probes only ever produced the wrong one. sqlite3, LuaJIT and libpng
# all have _ftol3, _dtol3, _ftoui3, _ftoul3 and _dtoul3_legacy removed by the
# existing baseline, while _ftol2, _ftoi2, _ftoui2 and _ftoul2 survive in
# Lua, LuaJIT, abseil, libpng and libtiff. The "3" set takes its argument in
# an XMM register, which is what /arch:SSE2 code has; the "2" set takes it on
# the x87 stack, which is where a __cdecl function that *returns* a double or
# a float leaves it on x86. That is what the surviving callers are:
# png_build_16bit_table converting the result of pow(), lj_cf_os_date and
# lj_cf_os_difftime converting the result of a function returning double.
# Hence the conversions below all run on the return value of an out-of-line
# function rather than on a variable.

    # The analysis above this probe is right and stands: the *2 set takes its
    # argument on the x87 stack, which is where a __cdecl function returning
    # a double leaves it, and that is what the surviving callers do. What it
    # did not account for is that cl is free to get the value off the x87
    # stack again before converting - at /O2 with the default /arch:SSE2 it
    # spills the return value to memory and reloads it into XMM, so the
    # conversion reaches _ftoul3 after all. /arch:IA32 removes that escape
    # route: with no XMM to reload into, the conversion has to go through the
    # x87 helpers.
    #
