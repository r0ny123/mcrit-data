"""LibTomCrypt built with MSVC, beside the MinGW build of the same tag.

This is the one family in the corpus where the MSVC build is **better data
than the MinGW one it joins**. makefile.mingw hardcodes ``-s`` on the DLL
link, so the committed MinGW artefacts are stripped: their recipe has to set
``min_named_ratio=0``, most of their function names come from the export
table, and because the CRT-glue filter matches on names it cannot act on the
unnamed remainder - ``removed_runtime_functions`` is empty for both. An
MSVC build carries a PDB, so this artefact is fully named and the glue filter
works on it.

A separate registry entry rather than another toolchain on the MinGW recipe,
for the reason spelled out in sqlite3_msvc.py: one Recipe has one build list
and these steps are cmd.exe, not sh.

What was read rather than assumed:
  * libtomcrypt 1.18.2's ``makefile.msvc``, in full. Its own comment says
    "this makefile builds only static libraries" and its only library target
    is ``tomcrypt.lib``; the default target is that library. ``LTC_CFLAGS``
    is ``/nologo /Isrc/headers/ /Itests/ /D_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
    /D_CRT_NONSTDC_NO_DEPRECATE /DLTC_SOURCE /W3 $(CFLAGS)`` - note
    ``$(CFLAGS)`` last, so anything passed on the command line wins - and its
    usage block documents the exact override used here:
    ``CFLAGS="/DUSE_LTM /DLTM_DESC /I…"  EXTRALIBS=…\\tommath.lib``.
    It contains **no /M flag at all**, so cl's default /MT would apply: the
    /MD below is the only thing keeping the MSVC C runtime out of this
    artefact.
  * libtommath 1.3.0 ships its own ``makefile.msvc``, whose default target is
    ``tommath.lib``. Its ``LTM_CFLAGS`` ends ``/Wall /wd4146 /wd4127 /wd4668
    /wd4710 /wd4711 /wd4820 /wd5045 /WX $(CFLAGS)``. **/Wall with /WX** on
    2019 code compiled by v143 is a build failure waiting to happen - v143
    has warnings that suppression list predates - so ``/WX-`` is appended
    through CFLAGS, which lands after /WX and turns warnings back into
    warnings. No /W level is passed with it: overriding /Wall as well would
    earn a D9025 "overriding '/Wall'" command-line warning, and whether /WX
    promotes *that* to an error is precisely the sort of thing not worth
    finding out in CI. This makefile too has no /M flag, so it also needs
    /MD or LibTomMath's objects arrive built against the static CRT.
  * both makefiles compile with ``$(CC) … /c $< /Fo$@`` and nmake's built-in
    ``CC = cl``. Neither uses the VC6 ``cl -o`` spelling that made bzip2's
    makefile.msc unusable here.
  * libtomcrypt's object list is ``src/ciphers/aes/aes.obj`` and 407 more
    like it - objects in subdirectories, updated by a bare ``.c.obj:``
    inference rule. NMAKE's documentation is self-contradictory about
    whether a rule with no braces reaches a target that carries a path, and
    that would be the whole build. It does: upstream's own ``appveyor.yml``
    runs ``nmake -f makefile.msvc all`` against this layout on the Visual
    Studio 2015, 2017, 2019 **and 2022** images, i.e. including v143, and
    builds libtommath with its ``makefile.msvc`` first in the same way this
    recipe does. That is upstream's CI rather than a reading of a manual.

Turning the static library into something SMDA can read is the remaining
work, and it is done the way the survey describes: a one-function anchor
object, linked into a DLL that pulls both archives in whole with
``/WHOLEARCHIVE``. The DLL exports nothing - 1.18.2 has no dllexport
annotations and this recipe does not add any - which is fine because the
names come from the PDB, and it is closer to the real sighting than an
export table would be: LibTomCrypt in the wild is compiled into its host.

# /WHOLEARCHIVE because nothing references these archives' members: without
# it the linker would take the anchor and discard both libraries, and the
# artefact would be a DLL containing one function. advapi32 is what
# upstream's own LTC_LDFLAGS links, for the system RNG in rng_get_bytes.c.
#
# The rest is the link line sqlite3_msvc.py explains: /DEBUG so a PDB is
# written at all, /Brepro so the PE carries no build timestamp and two runs
# over identical source record the same sha256, and /OPT:NOREF /OPT:NOICF so
# unreferenced and identically-compiled routines both survive as separate
# reference samples - which matters more here than anywhere else, since
# nothing in this DLL is referenced at all.
#
# Both archives are named twice on purpose: once as an ordinary input file,
# so the linker certainly loads them from this directory, and once in
# /WHOLEARCHIVE, which selects an already-named library by the spelling it
# was given. Naming a library in /WHOLEARCHIVE that the command line does
# not otherwise mention relies on the linker's library search to find it,
# which is one more thing that can quietly not happen.
#
# /INCREMENTAL:NO because /DEBUG implies /INCREMENTAL and the /OPT:NO* forms do
# not suppress it - only /OPT:REF, /OPT:ICF and /OPT:ORDER are documented to.
# An incrementally linked image reaches each function through a jump table, and
# SMDA recovers every one of those one-instruction thunks as a function of its
# own, unnamed. That was measured on the artefacts this omission produced: 978
# of libtomcrypt x86's 2030 functions and 966 of x64's 2017. It is not what a
