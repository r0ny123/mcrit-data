"""NTTITON's Heaven's Gate demonstration - MSVC only, x86 only.

A fifth WOW64-transition family beside wow64pp, wowGrail, RtlWow64 and
HeavensGate2, and the one written the way the technique is usually written:
five functions are ``__declspec(naked)`` with a full ``__asm { }`` body and
two more embed ``__asm`` blocks inside ordinary C. The far-call itself is
emitted a byte at a time through ``#define EMIT(a) __asm __emit (a)``
(Heavens Gate.h:4), which is how a 64-bit instruction gets into a 32-bit
translation unit that the assembler would otherwise refuse. Where
HeavensGate2 and RtlWow64 keep the gate in a byte array that is patched and
executed at run time, here it is in the instruction stream of the functions
themselves, which is a different thing for a matcher to see.

SCOPE. Only the ``Heavens Gate/`` subdirectory is built - two files,
``Heavens Gate.c`` (443 lines) and ``Heavens Gate.h`` (74 lines) - and
nothing else in this repository is compiled, copied, referenced or recorded.
That subdirectory is a self-contained demonstration of the technique and is
the only part the wishlist issue asks for. The rest of the repository is
working offensive malware: a browser-credential formgrabber with command and
control, hooking and injection, a PE infector and a process dumper. None of
it belongs in a reference corpus, and this recipe's compile step names its
one translation unit explicitly rather than globbing a directory, so nothing
can be pulled in by accident.

MSVC only, and not as a preference. ``__emit`` is an MSVC intrinsic with no
GCC equivalent, GCC has no working ``naked`` attribute on x86 at all, and
the ``__asm { }`` bodies are Intel syntax against a GCC that wants AT&T or a
basic-asm string. There is no partial port here; the file is unbuildable
outside MSVC.

x86 only, and this one is a hard limit of the compiler rather than of the
code: MSVC supports no inline assembly at all on x64, and
``__declspec(naked)`` is unsupported there as well. Seven of the eleven
functions are inline assembly. As with the other gates, there is also
nothing for it to do on x64.

There is no build system anywhere in the repository - no .vcxproj, no .sln,
no Makefile, no CMakeLists - so the compile and link lines below are this
recipe's own rather than upstream's, and build_flags says so. The directory
name contains a space, which is why the source path is quoted.

Eleven functions: memcpy64, GetPEB64, m_memcmp, GetImageBase,
GetModuleHandle64, GetNextArgument, CallFunction64, strlen64,
GetProcAddress64, SysCall64, and main. That clears
config.MIN_USEFUL_FUNCTIONS (8) by three, and two of the eleven -
``SysCall64`` and ``GetImageBase`` - are defined but never called from
anywhere in the file. Dropping them would leave nine, still over the floor
but pointlessly poorer, so the compile is /Od (no /Gy, hence no per-function
COMDATs to discard) and the link passes /OPT:NOREF. /OPT:REF must not be
added here.

# .c, so cl compiles it as C without /TC being asked for, which is what the
# __asm and __declspec(naked) bodies were written against. The include of
# "Heavens Gate.h" is quoted and resolves next to the source file, so no /I
# is needed.
#
# /Od: two of the eleven functions are never called and inlining is the other
# way to lose one, so nothing here is optimised. It also keeps
# GetNextArgument - a nine-line helper called eight times from two callers,
# which /O2 would inline at every site - as a function of its own.
#
# /MD, not cl's default /MT. The file calls printf and links the CRT for it;
# a static CRT put 1947 of VX-API's 4219 functions into that artefact as MSVC
# runtime, duplicating data/MSVC, which is this corpus's reference for
# exactly that code. With /MD the CRT stays in ucrtbase and only the startup
# glue is in the image, where the glue filter deals with it.
#
# /Zi with an /Fd of its own: MSVC keeps symbols in a PDB rather than in a
# COFF symbol table, and the compiler PDB has to be a different file from the
# linker PDB or link.exe writes the file it is reading type information from.

# /INCREMENTAL:NO is mandatory and is the most common way these builds fail:
# /DEBUG implies /INCREMENTAL, /OPT:NOREF and /OPT:NOICF do not suppress it,
# and an incrementally linked image reaches every function through a table of
# one-instruction jump thunks that SMDA recovers as functions in their own
# right - smdaify.assert_not_incrementally_linked refuses a run of more than
# 32 of them.
#
# /OPT:NOREF keeps SysCall64 and GetImageBase, which nothing calls;
# /OPT:NOICF stops identical-COMDAT folding, which is on by default in a
# release link.
#
# /Brepro drops the link timestamp so two runs give identical sha256s.
