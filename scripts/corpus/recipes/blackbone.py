"""BlackBone (mcrit-data issue #8) - MSVC only.

A Windows memory-hacking library: process and module management, manual PE
mapping, local and remote hooking, pattern search. It needs ATL and the DIA
SDK, both of which ship with Visual Studio and neither of which exists for
GCC, and its syscall stubs are MASM.

The solution only exposes Debug and Release, both of which build BlackBone as
a static library that SMDA cannot read. The project file itself also carries
a Release(DLL) configuration, so it is built directly - which means
SolutionDir has to be passed explicitly, because the project's OutDir is
defined relative to it and building a .vcxproj on its own would otherwise
resolve it to the project directory.

Release(DLL) statically compiles the vendored AsmJit and rewolf-wow64ext
sources into the same image, so those functions are present in this reference
data under the BlackBone family. That matches what an analyst meets in the
wild - upstream ships no configuration that leaves them out - but it is
recorded in the notes so the attribution is not mistaken for BlackBone's own
code. BeaEngine is different: it is linked through a prebuilt import library,
so only its thunks appear and its code stays in its own DLL.

The kernel driver has its own solution and is not built here: it is
blackbonedrv.py, a separate family, from the same commit. That recipe's
docstring argues the split - the two images share no code, and both recipes
pinning one commit would put two entries on the `(BlackBone, 2023-07-17)`
key that refresh_provenance.py cannot tell apart, since its narrowing is by
toolchain alias and both declare msvc_x64. The ``notes`` below point at that
family rather than claiming the driver is unbuilt, which they did until its
data was imported.
