"""CallObfuscator (d35ha) - MSVC only, both architectures.

A tool that rewrites a PE's import table so that static and dynamic analysis
see one API where another is called: the thunk that pointed at
VirtualProtect is made to point at Sleep, and a shellcode stub prepended to
the entry point resolves the real symbol at run time and puts it back. What
is recorded here is ``cobf.exe``, the tool, built from its own six
translation units - cli/cli.cpp, cli/ini.c, src/load.cpp, src/obfuscate.cpp,
src/shellcode.cpp and src/utils.cpp - and roughly 59 functions of its own.

The tool's *output* is deliberately not recorded. That output is a modified
copy of somebody else's binary, so its code is not this project's reference
material and filing it under this family would attribute another program's
functions to CallObfuscator. Only cobf.exe is an artefact here.

src/shellcode.cpp is the part worth looking at, and the reason this project
is more than an IAT rewriter. The injected shellcode is not a byte blob: it
is fourteen ordinary C++ static member functions of ``class shellcode`` -
exit, wstr_len, hash_string, str_cpy, str_toi, str_chr, ansi_to_wide,
wstr_cpy, wstr_i_cmp, get_dll_handle, load_dll, resolve_api_set,
get_symbol_ptr, load_syms - followed by a marker function ``funs_end``, and
the tool copies the bytes between the first and the marker out of its own
image at run time. Every one is declared ``no_inline``
(``__declspec(noinline)``, shellcode.hpp) and every one has its address
taken in the static ``shellcodes_funs`` table, so the linker can neither
discard nor fold them and the compiler cannot inline them away. The
extraction depends on MSVC emitting those functions contiguously and in
source order, which is why this artefact contains them as separate
functions and why the recipe leaves them separate.

MSVC only, and MinGW is further off than it first looks. As the tree stands
exactly one of the five C++ translation units compiles - src/utils.cpp -
because include/shellcode.hpp:13 includes ``<Windows.h>`` with a capital W,
which a case-sensitive cross-build cannot resolve, and the other four reach
that header. Correct the include case and four of the five compile, with
src/shellcode.cpp:16 still failing: ``PVOID shellcode::shellcode_start =
exit;`` is an invalid conversion from ``void (*)()`` to ``void *``.
Measured with x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ 13. Both of those are fixable; the
layout assumption above is not. A MinGW build would link and be functionally
wrong, which is worse than one that fails, so no MinGW recipe is written.

Both architectures are built. The tool's bitness has to match the PE it
patches, upstream provides all four Platform x Configuration combinations,
and src/load.cpp:238 and src/obfuscate.cpp:306-346 gate real code on
``_M_IX86``, so the x86 and x64 artefacts are not the same program compiled
twice.

# Six settings are forced through a props file imported with
# ForceImportBeforeCppTargets, the technique blackbone.py, q3vm_msvc.py and
# wowgrail.py use, so that no upstream file is modified.
#
# DebugInformationFormat is the one that has to be fixed rather than merely
# tidied. All four configurations set it to None (cobf.vcxproj lines 95, 114,
# 133 and 152), so the objects carry no debug information at all; the link
# does set GenerateDebugInformation, but a PDB built from objects compiled
# without /Zi holds public symbols only - no private symbols and no line
# information - and MSVC keeps symbols in a PDB rather than in a COFF symbol
# table, so SMDA would name very little of a 59-function image. Overridden to
# ProgramDatabase.
#
# RuntimeLibrary: upstream asks for MultiThreaded, i.e. /MT, which links the
# CRT statically. That put 1947 of VX-API's 4219 functions into that artefact
# as MSVC runtime, duplicating data/MSVC, which is this corpus's reference
# for exactly that code. /MD leaves it in ucrtbase and vcruntime140.
#
# OptimizeReferences and EnableCOMDATFolding: upstream's Release turns both
# on, i.e. /OPT:REF /OPT:ICF. Folding merges functions that compiled to
# identical bodies - it cost vxapi its StringConcat/StringCopy pair - and
# this project has several small string helpers in class shellcode that are
# plausible candidates. /OPT:REF would also be the wrong thing next to a
# shellcode region the tool identifies by address arithmetic over a
# contiguous run of functions. Both off.
#
# LinkTimeCodeGeneration is stated as well as WholeProgramOptimization being
# cleared on the command line, because the two reach the link by different
# routes and only the pair of them together guarantees no /LTCG.
#
# /Brepro drops the link timestamp so two runs give identical sha256s.
# /INCREMENTAL:NO because /DEBUG implies /INCREMENTAL and the /OPT:NO* forms
# above do not suppress it; Release already sets LinkIncremental false, but
# this recipe overrides enough of the link that inheriting it would be a
# thing to have to remember. Without it the image reaches every function
# through a table of one-instruction jump thunks and
# smdaify.assert_not_incrementally_linked refuses it.

# Release rather than Debug, deliberately. Debug sets LinkIncremental true,
# which assert_not_incrementally_linked refuses and which would have to be
# overridden anyway, and it sets MultiThreadedDebug - and the /MDd runtime is
# not one of the flavours baseline.py probes, so debug CRT glue would be
# mis-attributed to this family rather than dropped. Release needs /MT
# replaced, LTCG and the two /OPT switches turned off, and /Zi restored;
# after that it is an unoptimised, non-folding, fully symbolised build, which
# is what this corpus wants.
#
# /p:WholeProgramOptimization=false is a command-line global property rather
# than a props entry because the project sets WholeProgramOptimization in a
# PropertyGroup evaluated before Microsoft.Cpp.props, which a forced import
# is too late to reach. It is load-bearing here, unlike in heavensgate2.py
# where the project already disables /GL itself: LTCG inlines across
# translation units and would blur exactly the function boundaries
# src/shellcode.cpp depends on.
#
# PlatformToolset v142 is what the project asks for and the windows-2022
# runner image does not carry it - it ships VS2022 and v143 only.
# WindowsTargetPlatformVersion is already 10.0 upstream and is left alone.
#
# The solution's platforms are x86 and x64 and map to the project's Win32 and
# x64, so /p:Platform takes {arch} - the same reason q3vm_msvc.py passes
# {arch} there. The output path takes {msbuild_platform}, but unlike in
# q3vm_msvc.py that is a free choice rather than a forced one: q3vm inherits
# an upstream OutDir of $(SolutionDir)..\\bin\\$(Platform)\\$(Configuration)\\
# and therefore has to spell the directory the project's way, whereas this
# recipe pins OutDir itself just below and either spelling would have worked.
# {msbuild_platform} is used anyway so the tree on disk matches what MSBuild
# calls the platform everywhere else in the build.
#
# OutDir and IntDir are pinned rather than inherited, as wowgrail.py pins
# them: the Microsoft.Cpp defaults put a Win32 build one directory shallower
# than an x64 one, and pinning also keeps the compiler PDB
# (IntDir\\vc143.pdb, by MSBuild's own default) in a different directory from
# the linker PDB, which have to be separate files.
