"""libcurl built with MSVC, beside the MinGW builds of the same tags.

libcurl inside a downloader or a dropper is the archetypal MSVC-built
Windows dependency, and data/libcurl currently answers every one of those
sightings with GCC code. The survey ranks this third of thirty-one families
for coverage gained per unit of work.

A separate registry entry rather than another toolchain on the MinGW recipe,
for the reason spelled out in sqlite3_msvc.py: one Recipe has one build list
and these steps are cmd.exe, not sh.

What was read rather than assumed, at both pinned tags:
  * ``lib/CMakeLists.txt`` sets ``PREFIX "" OUTPUT_NAME
    "${LIBCURL_OUTPUT_NAME}"`` on the shared target, and
    ``LIBCURL_OUTPUT_NAME`` defaults to ``libcurl``. The "lib" is part of the
    name rather than a platform prefix, so the DLL is ``libcurl.dll`` under
    MSVC exactly as it is under MinGW - unlike lz4, where dropping the prefix
    renamed the artefact. It lands in ``lib/`` under the build directory,
    which is where the MinGW recipe already looks.
  * ``cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.7...3.16)`` at both tags. The policy
    range reaches past 3.15, so CMP0091 is NEW and CMake selects the runtime
    library through ``CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY`` - whose default is the DLL
    runtime - rather than by putting /MD in the flags. The /MD this recipe
    adds to ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE`` is therefore a duplicate under a NEW
    policy and the only source of it under an OLD one; either way the build
    is /MD, which is what matters.
  * ``CURL_STATIC_CRT`` exists at both tags and defaults to OFF, so nothing
    upstream flips this to /MT behind the recipe's back.
  * the OpenSSL default is computed as ``if(WIN32 OR CURL_USE_SCHANNEL OR …)
    set(_openssl_default OFF)``, so on Windows ``CURL_USE_OPENSSL`` is off
    before Schannel is even asked for, and ``find_package(OpenSSL)`` is never
    reached. That is checked rather than assumed because a windows runner
    does carry an OpenSSL, and libcurl absorbing it would put a second
    project's code under this family's name.
  * ``CURL_USE_LIBSSH2`` defaults to **ON** at both tags and
    ``USE_NGHTTP2`` defaults to ON at 8.15.0. Both are searched for with
    ``find_package``; neither was found in the cross environment the MinGW
    recipe configures in, which is why that recipe never had to name them.
    A windows-2022 runner is a different proposition - it carries vcpkg - and
    a found libssh2 or nghttp2 would be linked as a static .lib and absorbed.
    Both are switched off here explicitly.

Both configure lines were run through CMake (against the MinGW cross
compiler, which is what exists on this machine) and neither reported an
unused variable, so every option named below exists at both tags; both
reported "Enabled SSL backends: Schannel" and nothing else.
