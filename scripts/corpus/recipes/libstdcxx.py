"""libstdc++ - filling a gap in the existing MinGW coverage.

data/MinGW carries libstdc++ and libsupc++ on x64 (the r38 x64 report has
9806 functions, around 4700 of which demangle into std) but not on x86: the
r38 x86 report is 2818 functions, mostly Win32 import thunks, with no _ZN or
_ZSt symbols, no _Unwind_* and no libgcc helpers at all. So 32-bit libstdc++
is covered nowhere in the corpus.

This does not replace reprocessing the MinGW x86 inputs, which is the real
fix and is a question for the maintainer. It does give the corpus a 32-bit
libstdc++ reference in the meantime.

x86 only, for that reason: the gap is the whole point of the recipe. An x64
build here would be a second reference for code data/MinGW r38 x64 already
carries, and a duplicate reference sample is exactly what this corpus is
meant to avoid.

Uniquely among these recipes, the runtime is linked statically on purpose:
elsewhere -static-libstdc++ would be contamination, here it is the subject.
The C runtime is not, though - a bare -static would have dragged mingw-w64's
own startup code and libmingwex in beside it, which are neither libstdc++
nor this recipe's business.

Version coverage is limited to whatever GCC the host toolchain provides;
spreading it would need other mingw-w64 GCC builds.

# A DLL, not an EXE. The exerciser exports one function and defines no main,

# WinMain instead. It also drops the bare -static, which pulled mingw-w64's
# own CRT, libmingwex and the startup code into a sample that is supposed to
# be libstdc++: -static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc bring in the subject, and the
# C runtime stays where it belongs, imported from msvcrt.
