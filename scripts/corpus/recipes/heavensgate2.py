"""Heaven's Gate 2.0 (dadas190) - MSVC only, x86 only.

A fourth WOW64-transition family beside wow64pp, wowGrail and RtlWow64, and
a deliberately different one. wow64pp reaches the 64-bit side through
NtWow64QueryInformationProcess64 and a compiled stub; this one keeps every
64-bit sequence as a ``char inst[]`` byte array, VirtualAllocs an RWX page,
patches the immediates into it at run time and calls it. So the far-call to
selector 0x33 is not in the image as code at all - it is data, and the code
around it is the patcher. That is the shape an analyst meets when this
header has been copied into something, and it is what makes the sample worth
having beside the other three.

It carries no hand-written assembly - no .asm file, no __asm block, no
__declspec(naked) - which is true of three of the five Heaven's Gate
repositories surveyed for the wishlist issue rather than of this one alone:
grepping all five for those three forms finds hits only in RtlWow64
(RtlWow64.cpp:791, "__asm int 3;") and NTTITON's, leaving wow64pp, wowGrail
and this repository clean. wow64pp's freedom from inline assembly is in fact
its stated selling point, quoted from upstream in wow64pp_msvc.py. It is
nevertheless built with MSVC only, for the reason vxapi.py gives - the
single build system the repository ships is an MSVC solution, and a GCC
rendering of a 2017 Visual Studio proof of concept would be a code shape
nobody runs.

x86 only, and upstream agrees twice over. The solution's single
SolutionConfigurationPlatform is ``Release|x86`` and the project's single
ProjectConfiguration is ``Release|Win32``; the Debug and x64
PropertyGroups/ItemDefinitionGroups in HeavensGate.vcxproj are orphans that
no configuration selects. That is the whole of the argument and it is
sufficient on its own. The header is also written for 32 bits throughout -
it truncates 64-bit pointers with ``(uint32_t)(peb)`` and
``(uint64_t)(unsigned)(&ptr)`` 42 times on 37 lines - but that is not by
itself what rules out an x64 build: the project compiles as C (CompileAs
CompileAsC, recorded in build_flags), and in C a pointer-to-integer
narrowing cast is a diagnostic rather than an error. Measured on the x64
target with "x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -c -x c", it is 45 warnings, no errors
and rc=0. A library that opens a gate from 32-bit to 64-bit code has nothing
to do on x64 in any case.

Eleven functions: the ten in HeavensGate.h - memcpy64, GetPEB64,
GetModuleLDREntry, GetModuleHandle64, X64Call, MyGetProcAddress, MakeUTFStr,
GetKernel32, GetProcAddress64, LoadLibrary64 - plus Source.cpp's main. That
clears config.MIN_USEFUL_FUNCTIONS (8) by three, which is thin enough to be
worth stating: the whole project is one header and one 15-line example, and
nothing can be added without writing code upstream does not have. All eleven
survive because upstream's own Release configuration sets Optimization
Disabled and InlineFunctionExpansion Disabled, and because all ten are
reachable from main by a chain this recipe checked by hand
(main -> LoadLibrary64/GetProcAddress64 -> GetKernel32 -> MakeUTFStr,
MyGetProcAddress, X64Call; main -> GetModuleHandle64 -> GetModuleLDREntry ->
GetPEB64 -> memcpy64). /OPT:REF is nevertheless turned off below rather than
relied upon, because a dropped function here is a refused build.

Read the header, not the README. README.md documents a ``MakeANSIStr`` that
does not exist in the tree, gives MakeUTFStr the signature
``uint64_t MakeUTFStr(char *in)`` where the header has
``void MakeUTFStr(char *str, char *out)``, and describes X64Call as taking
four fixed arguments where the header is variadic
``X64Call(uint64_t proc, unsigned n, ...)``.

# Five settings are forced through a props file imported with
# ForceImportBeforeCppTargets, the technique blackbone.py, q3vm_msvc.py and
# wowgrail.py use, so that no upstream file is modified.
#
# GenerateDebugInformation: the project asks for DebugFastLink, i.e.
# /DEBUG:FASTLINK, which leaves the debug information in the .obj files and
# writes a PDB that merely indexes them. That PDB is only meaningful next to
# the object files that produced it, and MSVC keeps symbols in a PDB rather
# than in a COFF symbol table, so a report read with it would name almost
# nothing. Replaced with a full /DEBUG, and DebugInformationFormat stated as
# ProgramDatabase rather than left to the toolset's default.
#
# OptimizeReferences and EnableCOMDATFolding: the project turns both on, i.e.
# /OPT:REF /OPT:ICF. With eleven functions and a floor of eight, folding two
# together or discarding one is the difference between a sample and a refused
# build, so both are turned off here - the same reason vxapi.py passes
# /OPT:NOICF, where folding cost it its StringConcat/StringCopy pair.
#
# /INCREMENTAL:NO: the Release PropertyGroup already sets LinkIncremental
# false, but /DEBUG implies /INCREMENTAL and the /OPT:NO* forms above do not
# suppress it, so it is stated on the link line as well rather than inherited
# from a property this recipe also overrides other parts of. An incremental
# link would put a table of one-instruction jump thunks in front of every
# function and smdaify.assert_not_incrementally_linked refuses that.
#
# /Brepro: without it MSVC stamps the PE with the build time and two runs
# over identical source record different sha256s.
#
# AdditionalDependencies: kernel32.lib, named rather than inherited. The
# project sets IgnoreAllDefaultLibraries, so the /DEFAULTLIB directives the
# objects carry are ignored and only libraries on the link line are used;
# what the code actually references outside itself is VirtualAlloc,
# lstrcmpiW, lstrcmpA and lstrlenA, all four of them kernel32. Relying on
# MSBuild's default list for that would make the link depend on a toolset
# default this recipe cannot check without MSVC.
