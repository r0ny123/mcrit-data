"""RtlWow64 - a WOW64-transition DLL with an Rtl-shaped API. MSVC only.

A 32-bit process on 64-bit Windows keeps a second, 64-bit ntdll mapped that
its own loader will not show it. RtlWow64 reaches that side and wraps it in
the shape of the native API: RtlGetModuleHandleWow64,
RtlGetProcAddressWow64, RtlGetNativeProcAddressWow64, RtlLoadLibraryWow64,
RtlLoadKernel32X64 and RtlInvokeX64, backed by RtlpGetModuleHandleWow64 and
RtlpGetProcAddressWow64, which walk the 64-bit PEB loader list and parse the
x64 export directory by hand. Underneath them RtlpWow64Execute64 copies a
small "Heaven's Gate" thunk - the Wow64Execute byte array at
RtlWow64/RtlWow64.cpp:325 - into an executable heap and far-calls through
it. That is the sequence an analyst is looking for, and the reason this
project is worth a reference sample.

MSVC only, and not a preference. The sources use every Microsoft extension
at once, and each one alone is enough to stop GCC:

  * RtlWow64/RtlWow64.cpp:791 is "__asm int 3;", MSVC inline assembly.
  * RtlWow64/RtlWow64.cpp:21-24 is __try/__except with an exception filter,
    structured exception handling, which mingw's GCC does not implement.
  * RtlWow64/RtlNative.h declares its 64-bit structures with __ptr64
    pointer qualifiers throughout.
  * RtlWow64/RtlNative.h:21 is "#pragma comment(lib,\"ntdll.lib\")".

x86 only, and that is upstream's own conclusion: RtlWow64.sln maps only
Debug|x86 and Release|x86 onto the project's Win32 configurations, even
though RtlWow64.vcxproj carries x64 groups. It could not do otherwise. The
__asm above is rejected outright by a 64-bit MSVC front end, and the
NtWow64QueryInformationProcess64, NtWow64ReadVirtualMemory64 and
NtWow64WriteVirtualMemory64 that RtlNative.cpp resolves by name exist only in
the WOW64 ntdll - there is no gate to open from a native 64-bit process.

Upstream never tagged a release, so the pin is the full commit hash of
master as of 2021-02-12 and the version string is that date.

The project is built directly rather than through RtlWow64.sln. The solution
also carries test\\test.vcxproj, an executable that links against this DLL
and is no part of the reference data; building the one project keeps the
build to what is being collected.

No upstream file is modified. Four settings the project does not state, or
states in a way this corpus cannot use, arrive through an ItemDefinitionGroup
imported with ForceImportBeforeCppTargets - the mechanism blackbone.py
established here - and MSBuild imports it after the project's own groups, so
they win.

# RuntimeLibrary: Release|Win32 asks for MultiThreaded, i.e. /MT. That is the
# one compile setting this recipe overrides, for the reason cryptopp_msvc.py
# records - under /MT the MSVC C runtime is linked into the artefact and filed
# under this family, which is what put 1947 of VX-API's 4219 functions into
# that sample, duplicating data/MSVC. MultiThreadedDLL leaves it in
# ucrtbase.dll and vcruntime140.dll with only import thunks here.
#
# DebugInformationFormat: the Release|Win32 ClCompile group sets none, so
# whether the compiler emits debug information at all depends on an MSBuild
# default. This is not a question of whether a PDB exists - the project's
# GenerateDebugInformation is already true, so the linker writes one either
# way and build.py's declared-but-missing check would pass. It is a question
# of what is in it: a PDB built from objects compiled without /Zi carries
# public symbols only, with no private symbols and no line information, and
# MSVC keeps symbols in a PDB rather than in a COFF symbol table. That is
# the same failure callobfuscator.py forces ProgramDatabase to avoid. The
# override makes the compiler emit full debug information; the project's
# GenerateDebugInformation is left alone.
#
# /Brepro: without it MSVC stamps the PE with the build time, so two runs over
# identical source record different sha256s - which the BlackBone x86 DLL did
# between two green runs.
#
# /INCREMENTAL:NO: /DEBUG implies /INCREMENTAL, an incrementally linked image
# reaches every function through a table of one-instruction jump thunks, and
# SMDA recovers each of those as a function of its own - 2936 of
# nlohmann_json 3.12.0 x86's 5205, before
# smdaify.assert_not_incrementally_linked began refusing it. The project's
# own Release|Win32 PropertyGroup already sets LinkIncremental false and its
# OptimizeReferences would suppress it as well, so this is belt and braces
# on a sample small enough that a thunk table would be most of it.

# PlatformToolset has to be overridden: the project asks for v142, which the

# The same override blackbone.py needs, for the same reason.
#
# OutDir and IntDir are pinned rather than inherited. The project states
# neither, so both would come from the Microsoft.Cpp defaults, which for a
# Win32 target are written in terms of $(SolutionDir) - and this build does
# not go through a solution. Naming them puts the DLL and its linker PDB at a
# path this recipe can declare with no guesswork, and keeps the compiler PDB
# (IntDir\\vc143.pdb, by MSBuild's own default) in a different directory from
# the linker PDB, which is the separation nlohmann_msvc.py spells out.
