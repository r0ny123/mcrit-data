"""pe_to_shellcode loader stubs (mcrit-data issue #6).

The issue asks to "convert stubs from the project". They cannot be rebuilt
here - loader_v2 is built with `cl` plus `ml`/`ml64` and the external
masm_shc tool - but they do not need rebuilding: upstream commits the
compiled stubs as raw .bin files, and those MSVC-built bytes are what ships
inside anything using pe2shc. They are disassembled as buffers.

Only stub2 is covered. stub1 (`hldr32`/`hldr64`) is a single hand-written
assembly routine of ~130 instructions by hh86; it yields too few distinct
functions to carry a useful minhash, and the pipeline's minimum-function
check rejects it on those grounds. It also carries a separate CC-BY licence
that would require attribution if it were ever included.
