"""VX-API (mcrit-data issue #4) - MSVC only.

A collection of Win32 API-abuse routines. It cannot be built with GCC: a
handful of its 251 sources need ATL, and two use structured exception
handling, which mingw's GCC does not implement. More importantly, every
real-world sighting of this code is MSVC-compiled, so a GCC build would be a
proxy for something nobody ships.

This recipe therefore runs only under MSVC, which in practice means the
windows-2022 GitHub Actions runner (see .github/workflows/). Upstream ships
no static-library or DLL configuration, so the sources are compiled into one
and linked into a DLL with /OPT:NOREF, which keeps routines that nothing
calls - the point here is coverage, not a minimal binary.

# /Zi plus a shared /Fd writes debug info for every translation unit into one
# PDB, which is where MSVC keeps symbols; without it SMDA can only name
# exported functions and this DLL exports none.
# /MD is load-bearing. cl defaults to /MT, which statically links the CRT:
# the first build that way came back 46% MSVC C runtime by function count,
# 924 of them the __crt_stdio_output printf machinery, all of it attributed
# to VX-API and all of it overlapping data/MSVC, which is this corpus's
# reference for exactly that code. With /MD the CRT stays in ucrtbase and
# only import thunks appear. BlackBone's own project already builds this way.

# /FORCE:UNRESOLVED is load-bearing. The sources needing ATL or SEH are
# skipped, so anything referencing them is left unresolved and the link would
# otherwise stop at LNK1120. What is wanted here is the compiled function
# bodies, not a loadable DLL, and /OPT:NOREF keeps routines nothing calls.
# /OPT:NOICF as well as /OPT:NOREF. Identical COMDAT folding is on by
# default in a release link and merges functions with identical bodies,
# so StringConcat and StringCopy came back as one entry. Folding is
# right for a shipping binary and wrong here, where each routine is
# supposed to be its own reference sample.
# /Brepro makes the link reproducible: without it MSVC stamps the PE with
# the build time, so two runs over identical source produce artefacts
# with different digests and provenance records that cannot be compared.
#
# There is no /INCREMENTAL:NO here, and there does not need to be, which is
# worth writing down because seven other recipes did need one: /DEBUG implies
# /INCREMENTAL, and an incrementally linked image reaches each function
# through a table of one-instruction jump thunks that SMDA recovers as
# functions in their own right. /FORCE makes link.exe ignore /INCREMENTAL,
# so this artefact never had one - measured, not assumed: vxapi.dll's only
# one-instruction jumps are 185 ordinary tail calls, every one of them named.
# If /FORCE ever stops being load-bearing here, /INCREMENTAL:NO has to
# arrive in the same edit.
