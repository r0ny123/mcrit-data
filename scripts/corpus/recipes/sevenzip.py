"""7-Zip - one of the most embedded compression bodies on Windows.

7z.dll carries the archiver and every codec, including the LZMA
implementation that is among the most copy-pasted compression code in
Windows malware.

7-Zip publishes no checksums of its own; the digests recorded here were taken
from the fetched archives over HTTPS.

# Five settings are all needed and none are obvious:
#   IS_MINGW=1        - the makefile infers this from $SystemDrive, absent here
#   MSYSTEM=1         - otherwise it shells out to cmd.exe's del and mkdir
#   USE_ASM=          - the x64 assembly needs asmc (MASM syntax); nasm is not
#                       a drop-in substitute, so the hand-written
#                       LZMA/AES/CRC/SHA fast paths are absent. See notes.
#   LFLAGS_STRIP=     - 7zip_gcc.mak links with -s, which throws away the COFF
#                       symbol table this corpus depends on. 26.03 built
#                       cleanly that way and came back 16 of 5505 functions
#                       named.
#   CFLAGS_WARN_WALL= - the same file compiles with -Werror -Wall -Wextra, and
#                       GCC 13 rejects 23.01 outright over a -Wconversion
#                       warning in ComHandler.cpp that 26.03 later fixed.
#                       Diagnostics do not change the emitted code, so turning
#                       them off is a build setting; patching upstream to
#                       satisfy a newer compiler would not be.

# DOC/License.txt is not the same document in the two versions, so neither is
# this field. Both are LGPL-2.1-or-later with the unRAR restriction over the
# Rar* files and both carry Apple's BSD-3-Clause LZFSE decoder, but 26.03
# adds two more third-party bodies with their own terms: C/ZstdDec.c under
# BSD-3-Clause and C/Xxh64.c under BSD-2-Clause. That code is in the
# artefacts rather than merely in the tree - 26.03 x64 recovers 89 Zstd* and
# 11 Xxh* function names where 23.01 x64 has none of either, and the LZFSE
# decoder is named in all four - so recording one string for both versions
# understated what a 26.03 artefact carries.
