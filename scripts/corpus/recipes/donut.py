"""donut - position-independent loader generator (mcrit-data issue #5).

What is worth covering here is the loader, not the generator. The loader is
the position-independent code donut embeds in whatever it is asked to
package, so it is what turns up in samples; the generator is a builder that
runs on the operator's machine. Upstream commits the loader as MSVC-compiled
C arrays in loader_exe_x86.h and loader_exe_x64.h, and those same arrays are
what ships in the release binaries and in the donut-shellcode PyPI package,
so they are extracted and disassembled as buffers.

The generator is deliberately not built. Makefile.mingw links
lib/aplib64.lib, so donut.exe would statically contain aPLib's compressor -
and aPLib is already its own family in this repository, so those functions
would be duplicated under the donut name. The generator is also built
without any -O, which makes for poor reference code even setting the
duplication aside.

That reasoning does not clear the blobs, and the notes below say so. The
loader carries aPLib code too: Makefile.msvc compiles loader/depack.c into
loader.exe alongside loader.c, hash.c, encrypt.c and clib.c, and at the
pinned commit that file is headed "aPLib compression library ... C depacker
... Copyright (c) 1998-2014 Joergen Ibsen". The difference is that it cannot
be left out. Declining to build the generator costs nothing, because the
generator is not what turns up in samples; the depacker is part of the
loader donut ships, so any honest reference for that loader contains it.
What is attributed to donut here is therefore aPLib's own decompressor as
well - though not code data/aPLib already holds, since that family carries
the assembly depackers and packers from aplib.lib and aplib.a, which share
no PicHash with either blob.
