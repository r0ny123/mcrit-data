"""bzip2 built with MSVC, beside the MinGW build of the same tarball.

bzip2 on Windows lives in installers, archivers and update tooling, and all
of those are MSVC-built; data/bzip2 carries only MinGW artefacts.

A separate registry entry rather than another toolchain on the MinGW recipe,
for the reason spelled out in sqlite3_msvc.py: one Recipe has one build list
and these steps are cmd.exe, not sh.

What was read rather than assumed, in the 1.0.8 tarball:
  * ``makefile.msc`` is upstream's own MSVC build. Its flags are
    ``-DWIN32 -MD -Ox -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -nologo``, its targets are
    ``libbz2.lib`` (a static library, which SMDA cannot read) and
    ``bzip2.exe``, and there is no DLL rule at all - upstream ships
    ``libbz2.def`` but never links it on this path.
  * that makefile's inference rule is ``$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $*.c -o $*.obj``.
    ``cl -o`` is a VC6 spelling that current cl only accepts under a
    deprecation warning, and a makefile whose every object depends on it is
    not worth the cycle. So this recipe writes the two commands out by hand,
    exactly as the MinGW recipe does - that one does not use upstream's
    ``Makefile`` either - and keeps upstream's own ``-DWIN32`` and
    ``-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64``.
  * ``bzlib.h`` defines ``BZ_EXPORT`` unless ``BZ_IMPORT`` is set, and under
    ``_WIN32`` that makes every library entry point ``WINAPI``, i.e.
    ``__stdcall``. Nothing here has to ask for that and nothing may switch it
    off: it is the same decoration the MinGW artefact carries.
  * ``bzip2.c`` selects its ``BZ_LCCWIN32`` branch on ``_WIN32``, which cl
    defines; that branch uses ``setmode``, ``fileno`` and ``struct _stati64``
    from ``<io.h>``/``<sys/stat.h>``. The UCRT still declares all three, under
    a deprecation warning that ``_CRT_NONSTDC_NO_DEPRECATE`` and
    ``_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS`` silence. Neither is a code-generation switch.

The artefact is ``bzip2.exe``, not a DLL, and that is deliberate: the MinGW
recipe measured that the EXE statically links the same objects as the DLL and
is a superset of it by 45 of the DLL's 46 functions, so it ships the EXE
alone. An MSVC build that shipped a DLL instead would not be comparable with
its MinGW sibling, which is the whole point of adding it. SMDA reads a PE
image either way; what it cannot read is the static ``.lib``, and this recipe
never produces one.

# in a COFF symbol table.

# makefile.msc already asks for -MD, so this is not a deviation from it.
#
# /O2 rather than upstream's /Ox: the MinGW sibling is -O2, the other MSVC
# recipes here are /O2, and /O2 additionally implies /Gy, which puts each
# function in its own COMDAT - that is what makes /OPT:NOREF below able to

# The same link flags sqlite3_msvc.py explains: /DEBUG so a PDB is written at
# all, /Brepro so the PE carries no build timestamp and two runs over
# identical source record the same sha256, and /OPT:NOREF /OPT:NOICF so
# unreferenced and identically-compiled routines both survive as separate
# reference samples. setargv.obj, which upstream's makefile.msc links for
# wildcard expansion, is left out: it is CRT code, it is not needed for
# reference data, and the MinGW artefact does not carry it either.
#
# /INCREMENTAL:NO because /DEBUG implies /INCREMENTAL and the /OPT:NO* forms do
# not suppress it - only /OPT:REF, /OPT:ICF and /OPT:ORDER are documented to.
# An incrementally linked image reaches each function through a jump table, and
# SMDA recovers every one of those one-instruction thunks as a function of its
