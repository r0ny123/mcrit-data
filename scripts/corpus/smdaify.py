    ``link /DEBUG`` implies ``/INCREMENTAL`` and the ``/OPT:NO*`` forms these
    recipes pass do not suppress it - only ``/OPT:REF``, ``/OPT:ICF`` and
    ``/OPT:ORDER`` are documented to. An incrementally linked image reaches
    each function through a table of one-instruction jump thunks, every one
    of which SMDA recovers as a function in its own right. Seven recipes had
    this, and at the worst of them roughly half of what the corpus was
    calling a function was a thunk.

    It is worth a check of its own rather than trusting the recipes, for a
    reason the review of those recipes made plain: the symbol-coverage ratio
    above was the only thing in the pipeline that noticed, it noticed by
    accident, and the instruction floor it now uses would hide this entirely.
    bzip2 and libtomcrypt had been sitting within one percentage point of
    failing that gate for this reason and nobody had looked.

    The signature is what was measured on the artefacts the omission
    produced: a long unbroken run of unnamed single-instruction direct
    jumps, each exactly five bytes after the last, because that is what a
    table of ``E9 rel32`` is. In nlohmann_json 3.12.0 x64 the run is 2866
    entries from base+0x1005 with no other function inside its span.

    The run, not the count, is what separates it. Plenty of artefacts carry
    unnamed direct-jump functions without having a table - 7-Zip's MinGW x86
    reports carry 265 - but scattered through the image rather than packed.
    Over all 392 generated reports the longest such run outside an
    incrementally linked image is 18 and the shortest inside one is 70; see
    ``MAX_INCREMENTAL_THUNK_RUN`` for the full split.

    Kept unconditional now that the corpus has ELF artefacts as well, rather
    than narrowed to a PE: there is no /INCREMENTAL on ld, so it can only
    ever pass there, and a check that costs nothing is not worth making
    conditional on a format. It was measured rather than assumed - an ELF
    .plt entry is at a 16-byte stride, not five, and reaches its target
    through the GOT, so it is written "jmp qword ptr [...]" and
    _is_direct_target rejects it; the eight ELF artefacts in this corpus
    carry no unnamed direct-jump function at all, so their longest run is 0.
