// Instantiates Snowapril/String-Obfuscator-In-Compile-Time so its code is
// actually emitted.
//
// Two headers, no build system, and the whole cipher runs in the type system:
// nothing of the library exists in a binary until a translation unit expands
// OBFUSCATE. There is therefore no upstream artefact to disassemble, and the
// reference data comes from compiling this consumer.
//
// Three properties of the header dictate the shape of this file.
//
// OBFUSCATE(str) builds a snowapril::MetaString temporary and returns
// decrypt()'s char* out of it. The temporary dies at the end of the full
// expression, so the pointer must be consumed inside the same expression -
// assigning it to a `const char*` variable and using it on the next line is a
// dangling read. Every use below is therefore a single call expression.
//
// MetaString is templated on <index_sequence<I...>, A, B>, where A and B come
// from MetaRandom<__COUNTER__, ...>. __COUNTER__ advances twice per macro
// expansion, so every call is its own instantiation even at the same length,
// and lengths are spread anyway because the decrypt loop is bounded by
// sizeof...(I).
//
// MetaRandom drives LinearCongruentialEngine<16807, N, seed, Limit>, which
// recurses N times, and N is __COUNTER__ - so template instantiation depth
// grows at roughly twice the number of OBFUSCATE calls in the unit. GCC's
// default -ftemplate-depth is 900, which caps a single translation unit at
// about 450 strings; the 40 below stay far under that.
//
// Measured with GCC 13 at -O0: 4 functions per string (the constructor, the
// public decrypt(), and the private encrypt(char)/decrypt(int) pair) plus one
// shared snowapril::positive_modulo. At -O1 and -O2 the count is zero -
// everything folds into the caller.

// obfuscator.hpp is not self-contained: it declares
// `template <size_t... I, ...>` with an unqualified size_t and includes only
// <array> and its own meta_random.hpp, neither of which is guaranteed to
// declare ::size_t. GCC 13 with mingw-w64 headers rejects it on its own, so
// the consumer has to provide the declaration - including <cstddef> ahead of
// it is enough.
